# Welcome!
This repository is a simple ruby on rails project to learn how to work with RSpec.

## How to work with this repo?
It is quite simple - each exercise covers some features of RSpec, delving deeper with each step.
You can find each exercise in branches (work-in-progress):
- 01_describe_how_it_works
- 02_subject
- 03_let
- 04_factories
- 05_before
- 06_mocks_and_stubs
- 07_shared_contexts_and_examples
- 08_final

Each exercise builds on top of the previous one. After completing the exercise, check out the next branch -
it will contain a solution to the previous exercise (but maybe not before you've attempted it yourself),
and the next exercise will be prepared for you!
